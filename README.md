# Dynamic Visualisation for Clarke and Park Transforms

The purpose of this project is to provide an graphic based UI for the user to dynamically visualise and analyse the Clarke Transform and Park Transform for balanced three-phase inputs. 

## Getting Started

Type the following in your terminal:

```python

	python gsyDqMain.py
```
This should let Python to run the main script.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.5+
* maplotlib
* numpy
* tkinter
* threading
* time
* os
* sys
* glob
* FFmpeg


[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) 5.0.1 should have everything except FFmpeg. You can get at [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)


### Installing

You must install Python first. And then download the whole master trunk to your local machine. 

Make sure you have the following file:

* gsyDqMain.py
* gsyDqLib.py
* gsyIO.py
* gsyINI.py

Other files are mainly for automatic documentation generation via sphinx.

Here are two useful links for using sphinx:

* [Sphinx Autodoc Tutorial for Dummies](https://codeandchaos.wordpress.com/2012/07/30/sphinx-autodoc-tutorial-for-dummies/)
* [Adding Numpydoc to Sphinx](https://codeandchaos.wordpress.com/2012/08/09/sphinx-and-numpydoc/)

A detailed how to use can be found in the [documentation](documentation/html/index.html).
