Input Harmonic Order : 
This sets the order of harmonic to be analysed. 1st order is the fundamental. This input needs to be a float.

PLL Order : 
This sets the angular velocity of the PLL as multiples of the fundamental frequency. This input needs to be a float.
Positive number means the PLL is rotating anti-clockwise.
Negative number means the PLL is rotating clockwise.

Samples :
This sets how many samples are taken within one fundamental period. This also sets the total frames for the video. 
Increasing this number would make the curves smoother. But the program would consume more resource.

FPS :
This sets the frame rate for saving video. This frame rate is not applied when runing on-the-fly.

Base Freq :
This sets the fundamental frequency.

NOTE : you'd better to stop the video first before changing the above input field settings.

Stop :
This button would stop the video. You can ONLY change the input fields when the video is stopped.

Play :
This button would refresh the video. Any updates made to the input fileds would be applied.

Save video :
This button would trigger the video to be saved. NO progress would be displayed due to the use of
maplotlib's built-in save function. A message would be prompted when the save is finished.
The codec FFmpeg is required. It's free to download and use. The FFmpeg binary (ffmpeg.exe) is required. 
It's usually located in the "bin" folder. The video length equals Samples divided by FPS.

Browse : 
This button would allow you to browse for the FFmpeg binary.
The path would be saved to an ini file and loaded on next program start-up.
